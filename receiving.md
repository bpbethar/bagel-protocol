# What to do when mutants come in 

We'll get a 96-well plate from GenScript with 1-2 ng of plasmid DNA (dried down) in each well. Either you will be provided with a well map, or uou can use the `gs-checker` to verify the sequences of your Kunkel constructs, which will give you a map to the mutant in each well. 

## Mise en place 

+ plate from GenScript
+ autoclaved 2 mL tubes 
+ nuclease-free water 
+ waste bucket 
+ P200
+ tips for P200
+ pen
+ ToughTags 

## Instructions

For each mutant from running the `gs-checker`, perform the following steps:

1. Label a ToughTag with the mutant name 
1. Affix to 2 mL tube 
1. Add nuclease-free water to a volume of 50 µL to the well containing your mutant. If it's completely dry, add 50 µL; if there is liquid, add nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 µL 
1. Pipet up and down 5 or 6 times to mix 
1. Transfer the entire volume to the labeled 2 mL tube
