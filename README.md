# Laboratory protocols for production and assay of β-glucosidase B 

The characterization of point mutants of β-glucosidase B from *P. polymxa* ("Bagel") is an ongoing project in the Siegel group. This repository contains all the laboratory protocols for the production and assay of mutants of this enzyme. 

+ `production.md` contains the instructions for production of protein beginning from purified plasmid 
+ `kinetics.md` contains instructions for an assay to determine Michaelis-Menten parameters in a convenient plate assay 
+ `thermostability.md` contains instructions for an assay to determine an enzyme's melting point
+ `recipes.md` contains recipes for stock solutions used in the above three protocols 

These recipes are robust enough to allow those new to enzyme engineering (and indeed, those new to lab work) to produce high-quality, consistent results. Along with [data analysis tools](http://github.com/dacarlin/fitter/) for determining Michaelis-Menten parameters from experimental data, this repository provides a basis for any lab to get started with enzyme design.
