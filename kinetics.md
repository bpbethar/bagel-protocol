# Assay to determine kinetic parameters of β-glucosidase B 

This assay assumes that you have followed the protein production and purification steps in `production.md` in this repository. 

## Before you begin

Before beginning this procedure, do a quick test of the enzyme activity of your mutants. To do this, mix 90 μL substrate stock and 10 μL purified protein in 2 mL tube. 

If this turns yellow within five minutes, make 1/100 dilutions of protein by mixing 10 μL purified protein and 990 μL wash buffer in labeled 2 mL tube. Else, make 1/10 dilutions of protein by mixing 100 μL purified protein to 900 μL wash buffer in 2 mL tube. 

Use the diluted purified protein for the remainder of the procedure. The undiluted stock can be used to run a gel and quantiate protein concentration by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. 

## Mis en place 

+ waste bucket 
+ P200 and tips
+ Multichannel pipet 5-50 µL

## Software 

Material | Amount per reaction |
---------|---------------------|
Diluted purified protein | 600 µL |
Substrate stock | 1800 µL |
Wash buffer | ~ 5 mL |

## Instructions 

First, make the substrate plate. You can use any convenient plate for this, PCR plates are good
 
1.  Dispense 150 μL of substrate stock into the first row (12 wells) 
2.  Dispense 112.5 μL of protein buffer into the rest of the rows (84 wells)
  
Perform a fourfold serial dilution with a multichannel pipet

1. Using the multichannel pipet, remove 37.5 μL from the first row and add to second row
2. Mix by pipetting up and down a few times 
3. Repeat this procedure for the second, third, forth, fifth, and sixth rows
4. Remove 37.5 uL from the seventh row, and throw away with the tips
5. The eighth row (control) contains only 112.5 µL buffer 
6. Verify that every well in the plate is the same volume as the control row (112.5 µL)

Now that you have created the gradient of substrate concentrations necessary to determine the kinetic parameters of the enzyme, aliquot your proteins in your assay plate

1.  For each mutant, aliquot 25 µL of diluted purified protein into three columns of the plate (24 wells)

To initate the assay, transfer 75 µL from each well in the substrate plate into the assay plate containing your aliquotted protein. Before you begin the instructions below, set the plate reader to monitor absorbance at 420 nm every minute for 60 minutes. 

1.  Using the multichannel pipet, transfer 75 µL from the bottom row of the substrate plate into the bottom row of the assay plate
2.  Repeat for the rest of the rows 
3.  Place the plate on the prepared plate reader to collect your data


## Tips and tricks

+ How to set up the plate reader will depend on which software you're using to control your plate reader
